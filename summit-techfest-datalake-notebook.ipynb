    "- They provide a precise representation of the underlying semi-structured data, especially when dealing with columns or fields with varying types.\n",
    "- They also provide powerful primitives to deal with nesting and unnesting.\n",
    "- A dynamic record is a self-describing record: Each record encodes its columns and types, so every record can have a schema that is unique from all others in the dynamic frame.\n",
    "- For ETL, we needed somthing more dynamic, hence we created the Glue Dynamic DataFrames. DDF are an implementaion of DF that relaxes the requiements of having a rigid schema. Its designed for semi-structured data.\n",
    "- It maintains a schema per-record, its easy to restucture, tag and modify. \n",
